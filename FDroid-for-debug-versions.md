There is a repo for debug versions available, maintained by [@j2ghz](https://github.com/j2ghz).

The repo url is `https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/repo`. If you want to see all versions, not just 3 latest, you can use `https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/archive` as well. You can test availability by checking https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/repo/index.xml

Example packages:

| App id                           | App name         | Explanation             | Version    | Version explanation             |

I was also building pull requests, but since I didn't use it, I disabled it. If someone is interested in them, I can enable it.
