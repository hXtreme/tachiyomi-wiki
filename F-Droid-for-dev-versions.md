There is an [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.fdroid.fdroid) repo for dev versions available, maintained by [@j2ghz](https://github.com/j2ghz).

The repo url is `https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/repo`. If you want to see all versions, not just 3 latest, you can use `https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/archive` as well. Versions are named `[latest release].[commit count]`. You can test availability by checking https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/repo/index.xml

### TL;DR
1. Add `https://fdroid.j2ghz.com/repo` as repo to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.fdroid.fdroid)
2. Install `Tachiyomi` from F-Droid (app id `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.debug`)
